Recently I used this app and got the fellow passenger which reduced the fare to half amount. Overall, I think your app is great and I really appreciate the hard work that you and your team have put into it. Thank you for creating such a useful tool."

                “I was lucky enough to stumble across “Go Pool” ride sharing app. If you’re staying far away from Bangalore Airport and you don’t mind sharing a ride with someone of your vicinity and split the bills, this is the right platform for you.
You can select your destination and connect with your potential co passenger hassle free. 
As this is a new app, would recommend to make app changes to ensure pre booking before boarding flight to Bangalore.”
